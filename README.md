# Pac-Man Game in Java

This project is a Java-based recreation of the classic Pac-Man arcade game. It features a custom-designed maze, playable Pac-Man character, food items, and ghosts that follow simple movement patterns.

## Features

- **Playable Pac-Man**: Navigate the maze, avoid ghosts, and collect food pellets.
- **Ghost Characters**: Four distinct ghosts represented by different colors, each with simple AI to increase the challenge.
- **Custom Maze**: A predefined map layout featuring walls, paths, food, and ghost spawn points.
- **Retro Graphics**: Pixel-style images for Pac-Man, ghosts, and walls, giving a retro arcade feel.

## Game Structure

The game uses Java Swing for the UI and `JPanel` for custom rendering, creating a grid-based map with images to represent the various elements like walls, ghosts, food, and Pac-Man.

##Resources

Ensure all necessary image files (wall.png, blueGhost.png, orangeGhost.png, redGhost.png, pinkGhost.png, and Pac-Man images) are in the same directory as the Java files or in a designated resources folder.

##Game Controls

Arrow Keys: Use the arrow keys to control Pac-Manâ€™s movement around the maze.
